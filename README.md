**AIS information that we used in our machine learning model, was published as open-source by the Danish Maritime Authority. The aforementioned data were compiled from the ships transiting the Kattegat Strait between January 1st and March 10th, 2022.**

**Two types of data, static and dynamic, are kept in the AIS device:**

**Static Information :**

*1. The ship's IMO number*

*2. The ship's MMSI number*

*3. The ship's Call Sign*

*4. The ship's name*

*5. The ship's type*

*6. What type of destination this message was received from (like Class A / Class B)*

*7. Width of ship*

*8. Length of ship*

*9. Draft of ship*

*10. Type of GPS device*

*11. Length from GPS to bow (Length A)*

*12. Length from GPS to stern (Size B)*

*13. Length from GPS to starboard (Size C)*

*14. Length from GPS to port side (Dimension D)*


**Dynamic Data:**

*1. Time information (31/12/2015 in 23:59:59 format)*

*2. Latitude*

*3. Longitude*

*4. Navigational status (For example: 'Fishing', Anchored, etc.)*

*5. Rate of Turn (ROT)*

*6. Speed Over Ground (SOG)*

*7. Course Over Ground (COG)*

*8. Heading*

*9. Type of cargo*

*10. Port of Destination*

*11. Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)*

*12. Data source type, eg. AIS*
